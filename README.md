# THE plan for the 3rd chapter

- There will be about a month of me being like a pony on a field running around. So this will be the plan of me being loose, longing for what;

### Me being loose - the prequel (Dec, 2020)

- Learn some random things that I'm not likely to learn EVER in my life durin this period: preparation for the 3rd chapter, such as:

##### Random stuffs

1. Cooking
2. Chinese, Spanish(?)
3. Yoga
4. Drums

##### Me, as a programmer

1. Preparing Master's degree, but on what and for what? - passing on to me being myself
   - Prepare all the materials that I have done in the past
   - Show it in an organized form
   - Get TOEFL score
   - Do research on labs/profs and get in contact with them
2. Getting the basis on various algorithms w/ Python3
3. Web skills in basic FE/BE
   - make my own webpage to introduce who I am and what I've done
4. dive into ML/DL
5. get a bit familiar to Apple eco system
   - swift/obj-c
   - launch an app?
6. Statistics and linear algebra
7. Regular expression - basic at least

##### Me, being myself
1. Preparing Master's degree, but on what and for what?
   - I do know that a program or service is just a means of achieving somethings else. I don't always need a car to get somewhere else; some other cheaper/faster vehicles work just fine for the purpose.
   - Programming/making a service is just a means. Being good at it might let me get higher salary, but in the end it is all about 'getting something done easily'.
   - So the point is that it's all about 'defining the problem and the way to solve it'. There always is a way, which is just not written on a textbook.
   - Basically, the reason why I'm thinking of applying for master's is a sort of vague expectation that the degree itself might make my life better.
   - But at the same time, I do have desire on knowledge itself.
   - So it seems I'm assuming that getting a degree will, eventually, the winning way.
1. What to do for living, ultimately?
   - Business-related skills and some other soft skills seem more required when I look at my life from a further view, and yet it isn't something that can be taught at school, nor can be purchased.
   - I guess there needs to be an experimental period, such as launching a small app and experiencing the full cycle of this IT service eco system.
